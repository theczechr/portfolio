## Forking

Although I've done my best to make it easy to fork and use, this is my personal portfolio, so I've embedded one of my projects, [Hyprfolio](https://github.com/theczechr/hyprfolio), under the `/hyprfolio` route, you might wanna remove it ;). If you wanted to use it, for whatever reason, it's included as a Git submodule, so you will need to initialize it after cloning (`git submodule update --init --recursive`).

Feel free to fork this repository and use it as a starting point for your own portfolio.
